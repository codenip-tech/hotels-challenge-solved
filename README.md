# Hotels coding challenge

## Test
We have to create a simple application that allow us to search hotels that meet our needs. We can search by available rooms or by service.

We already have the basic structure of the application:
- 1 command to search hotels by available rooms in a range (e.g: min 3, max 8)
- 1 command to search hotels by service (e.g: pool, gym, restaurant)
- 3 interfaces to have a certain contracts in our code
- 1 file with an example of a JSON response (please DO NOT use this file to solve the challenge, use the endpoint provided instead)
- The JSON response with hotels information can be requested to this endpoint: https://run.mocky.io/v3/6a7b91d6-377a-491d-a084-2066cf911065

We want you to implement a solution using the commands and interfaces provided. These interfaces are basic, so if you want to update them or even create new ones, you are allowed to do that.

There is a `tests` folder so you can write some tests for your code

### What we look at
- We are looking for a simple an efficient solution that can be easily maintained or scaled.
- We are interested on how you structure the code and the patterns you are able to use depending on the case
- We would like to see how you test your code

### Requirements
- You will need PHP 7.4 installed on your machine
- You will also need Composer to install dependencies

### Installation
- Run `composer install` to install dependencies
- You can run `composer test` to execute your tests

#### Have fun!
